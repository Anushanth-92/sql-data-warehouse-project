  Stores raw data as-is from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.

- **🔸 Silver Layer**:  
  Applies data cleansing, standardization, and normalization techniques to prepare data for analysis.

- **🏅 Gold Layer**:  
  Contains business-ready data modeled in a star schema optimized for analytics and reporting.
